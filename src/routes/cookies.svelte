	<h1 class="titles">1- How do cookies work?</h1>
	<p class="paragraph">
		When you visit a website, a cookie is a tiny text file that the website
		keeps on your computer or mobile device. It allows the website to remember
		your activities and choices (such as login, language, font size, and other
		display settings) over time, so you don't have to re-enter them every time
		you return to the website or navigate from one page to the next. Cookies are
		used on our site to differentiate you from other users and to make the site
		easier to use and more relevant to you. This basically assists us in
		providing you with a positive browsing experience while also allowing us to
		enhance our site.
	</p>

	<h1 class="titles">2- Cookies we use</h1>
	<p class="paragraph">
		On our website, we utilize two sorts of cookies: session cookies and
		persistent cookies. A session cookie is a cookie on your device until you
		leave our site. Session cookies are crucial for the correct functioning of
		our website as they enable you to move about our site and use our
		functionality. You will remain on your device for a long time until a
		persistent cookie is manually deleted (how long the cookie remains on your
		device will depend on the duration or "lifetime" of the specific cookie and
		your browser settings).
	</p>
	<h1 class="titles">3- Third party cookies</h1>
	<p class="paragraph">
		You may come across embedded material or be routed to other websites while
		using our site. Cookies may be used by these third-party websites and
		embedded content. Even if you are referred to a website via our site, we

	<h1 class="titles">4- Control of the cookies</h1>
	<p class="paragraph">
		We will presume that you are happy to receive all cookies on our site if you
		continue to use it without changing your preferences. You have complete
		control over cookies and may delete them at any time. For more information,
		go to aboutcookies.org. You may remove any cookies that have already been
		installed on your computer, and most browsers can be configured to prevent
		them from being installed. You may have to manually modify some choices
		every time you visit our site if you do this, and some functions may not
		operate.
